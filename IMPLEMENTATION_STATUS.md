# Netssh-rs Implementation Status

## Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- [x] SSH connection handling for network devices
- [x] Device abstraction layer with vendor-specific implementations
- [x] Session logging
- [x] Error handling with custom error types

### REST API
- [x] API server implementation with Actix Web
- [x] Command execution endpoints (show, configure)
- [x] Interface management endpoints
- [x] Standardized JSON responses
- [x] Basic error handling

### Documentation
- [x] Updated README with API usage examples
- [x] Implementation plan with architecture diagrams
- [x] Example code for API usage

## In Progress / Future Work

### Connection Management
- [x] Fix type issues in connection pooling implementation
- [ ] Implement connection health monitoring
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling
- [ ] Implement automatic reconnection

### API Enhancements
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request validation
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for better performance

### Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide with examples

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests for device operations
- [ ] Create mock devices for testing

## Known Issues
1. ~~Connection pooling implementation has type compatibility issues~~ (Fixed by implementing NetworkDeviceConnection for Box<dyn NetworkDeviceConnection + Send> in device_connection_impl.rs)
2. Error handling could be improved with more specific error types
3. No authentication mechanism for API endpoints

## Next Steps
1. Add authentication to API endpoints
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Improve error handling with more specific error types
