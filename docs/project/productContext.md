# Product Context: netssh-rs

## Purpose
netssh-rs exists to provide a robust, secure SSH implementation in Rust, offering an alternative to existing C/C++ implementations like OpenSSH and allowing for better integration with Rust ecosystem projects.

## Problem Statement
Traditional SSH implementations are often written in C/C++, which can present security concerns due to memory safety issues. By implementing SSH in Rust, netssh-rs aims to leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees while providing a modern, maintainable codebase for SSH functionality.

## Target Users
- Rust developers building networked applications
- System administrators who prefer Rust-based tools
- DevOps engineers integrating with Rust ecosystems
- Security-focused developers who value Rust's memory safety
