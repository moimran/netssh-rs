# System Patterns: netssh-rs

## Architecture Overview
netssh-rs appears to be a Rust-based implementation of SSH networking capabilities, structured as a Cargo workspace with multiple crates.

## Key Components
- Cargo workspace structure with multiple crates
- Potential division into client and server components
- Core SSH protocol implementation
- Cross-platform networking capabilities

## Technical Decisions
- Implementation in Rust for memory safety and performance
- Modular crate structure for separation of concerns
- Use of standard Rust patterns for error handling and API design

## Design Patterns
- Likely uses builder patterns for configuration
- Error handling through Result types
- Trait-based interfaces for extensibility
- Async/await patterns for network operations

## Code Organization
- Multiple crates under the `crates/` directory
- Test directory for integration tests
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Makefile for build automation
